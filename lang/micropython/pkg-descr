Micro Python is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3
programming language that includes a small subset of the Python
standard library. Although MicroPython is designed to run on
microcontrollers and in constrained environments, the Unix port
has been adapted to run on CheriBSD with support for bounded
capabilities.
